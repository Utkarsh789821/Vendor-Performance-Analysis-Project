Vendor Performance Analysis â€“ Retail Inventory & Sales | SQL, Python, Power BI
Objective: Analyzed vendor efficiency and profitability to support strategic purchasing and inventory decisions.

Developed and optimized a complex SQL ETL pipeline to build an aggregated summary table from multiple tables. Improved query performance using CTEs and data filtering, significantly reducing processing time for large datasets.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing in Python solving research questions to evaluate vendor profitability, pricing strategy effectiveness, and inventory turnover.

Identified over-dependence on top 10 vendors (65.7% of purchases) and uncovered $2.71M in unsold inventory from low-performing vendors, recommending diversification and inventory optimization.

Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize vendor performance, profit margins, bulk purchasing impact (72% cost reduction), and actionable insights for decision-makers.
